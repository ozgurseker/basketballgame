# basketballgame

In this repo, I am working on my simple basketball game idea on tkinter Python.

What I have learned/done:
- How to set background image as halfcourt, 
- Extracted lines from the halfcourt image
- Found boundaries and place a player randomly into the halfcourt

Next steps:
- Extract different areas from the image through reading pixels. Like 3pt area, painted area, the basket etc. 
- Place 5 random players on the court with numbers on them for each team. 
- Dependent on locations of all players on court, generate a basket probability for each player. 
- Want user to choose a player to attack with
- An optional timer to make move
- Dependent on the calculated probability, it is successful or not.

Further plans:
- Make defense move towards their man (or between basket-their man)
- Allow different type of players, different features and computational complexity on probabilities.
- Go to rim or shoot options
