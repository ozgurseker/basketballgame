# basketballgame

In this repo, I am working on my simple basketball game idea on tkinter Python.

Now I am learning how i could set my background image as a half court and set some points/players on it. 

Next steps:
- Extract different areas from the image through reading pixels. Like 3pt area, painted area etc.
- Place 5 random players on the court with numbers on them for each team. 
- Dependent on locations of all players on court, generate a basket probability for each player. 
- Want user to choose a player to attack with
- An optional timer to make move
- Dependent on the calculated probability, it is successful or not.
